# Game Search App

* Connects to the Giantbomb video game database API and retrieves data using the **jQuery.ajax()** method.
* Uses **JSONP** format because of CORS.
* Includes a *search* feature, passing the selected result to a new page using *sessionStorage*, and showing more *details* about the selected item.
* Populates the HTML elements using **jQuery**.
* It only has basic styling done through *Bootstrap* and custom *CSS*, since the focus of this project is the API connectivity, not styling.

## Future plans:
~~- [ ] Figuring out pagination, since it only shows first 10 results.~~
**I have a new version of this project done in React instead.**
